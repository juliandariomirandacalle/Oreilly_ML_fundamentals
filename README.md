# Machine Learning Fundamentals
This reposiory is the code implementation of the practical sessions of the [Machine Learning fundamentals' O'Reilly Python-based course](https://www.oreilly.com/videos/machine-learning-fundamentals/0636920927884/) by [JuliÃ¡n Miranda](https://github.com/juliandariomirandacalle/). All algorithms are described in the notebooks included in the content and developed in Python.

# Repository Content
The content of the repository is distributed as follows:

```
â”œâ”€â”€â”€Module 4
    â””â”€â”€â”€Video11_SL_Python
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€data_files
        â””â”€â”€â”€Video11_SL_Python.ipynb
â””â”€â”€â”€Module 5
    â””â”€â”€â”€Video4_UL_Python
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€data_files
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€MNIST.py
        â””â”€â”€â”€Video4_UnsupervisedLearning.ipynb
```

Module 4 covers some Supervised Learning algorithms implemented within a business problem stated in [Video11_SL_Python.ipynb](https://github.com/juliandariomirandacalle/Oreilly_ML_fundamentals/blob/main/Module%204/Video11_SL_Python/Video11_SL_Python.ipynb). Whlie Module 5 covers Unsupervised Learning algorithms focuesd on dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis with a real application example in [Video4_UnsupervisedLearning.ipynb](https://github.com/juliandariomirandacalle/Oreilly_ML_fundamentals/blob/main/Module%205/Video4_UL_Python/Video4_UnsupervisedLearning.ipynb).

# Setting the development environment
You can run the notebooks in your local Python environment. You need minimum technical specifications to run the notebook, since most of the methdods implemented have low time and space complexities. Alternatively, you can use Colab to run the notebooks. If that is the case, see [these instructions on how to use Google Colab with GitHub](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb).
